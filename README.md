# Titanic-Survival-First-Submission
When I started ML and Data Science I thought it is quite easy as all the libraries are available but while doing this case study I came to knew that I was completely wrong.. This my first submission and hopefully the predictions would be good.. While practicing on this dataset for 4 days straight I learned a lot which was very different that what I studied in the online courses.. But courses did help to make a base.. Hopefully this would also help other beginners These sources https://www.kaggle.com/nadintamer/titanic-survival-predictions-beginner , https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/kaggle-python-tutorial-on-machine-learning/getting-started-with-python?ex=1 , udemy A-Z ML course helped me alot.. Thanks to all these guys...
